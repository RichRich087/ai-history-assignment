Futute ideas
A interactive game could be created where the user can play against an AI.



Testing 

Throughout the production cycle extensive testing was implemented. Any major change was visually checked on the website. Over all the expierence was pretty error free. One issue that arose early on was a large gap between the image and the nav elements. At first we tried implementing changes manually and visually checking. However after using the developer tools the issue was quickly resolved and became a intregal part of the rest of the creation process. 

No issues appear to be present. Both the CSS Validator and Jigsaw validator where used.

Deployment

Website has been deployed using github. The instructional videos are not upto date however a quick google helped reveal the missing information.


"To deploy a project on GitHub, start by creating a repository on the GitHub website. Next, clone the repository to your local machine using git clone. Add your project files to the cloned directory and navigate to it using the terminal or command prompt. Commit your changes with git add . followed by git commit -m "Your commit message". Finally, push your committed files to the GitHub repository using git push origin master. If you're deploying a website, consider using GitHub Pages by selecting the appropriate branch in your repository's settings. With this, your project becomes accessible and shareable via GitHub."


Bugs:
We had an issue with a big gap at the top of the website. After using developer tools we figured out how to remove it.

Remaining Bugs:
None.
