Testing 

Throughout the production cycle extensive testing was implemented. Any major change was visually checked on the website. Over all the expierence was pretty error free. One issue that arose early on was a large gap between the image and the nav elements. At first we tried implementing changes manually and visually checking. However after using the developer tools the issue was quickly resolved and became a intregal part of the rest of the creation process. 

No issues appear to be present. Both the CSS Validator and Jigsaw validator where used.

Deployment

Website has been deployed using github. The instructional videos are not upto date however a quick google helped reveal the missing information.
